To run this application, you should have RDO 2.0 and DAO 3.51 installed on your computer. These are installed when you install VB on your system. 

Your are allowed to customize the code yourself, we encourage you to use ADO inplace of RDO, if you are hesitant of doing it yourself then wait for us to write another article in which we will show how to create Master/Detail form using ADO.
